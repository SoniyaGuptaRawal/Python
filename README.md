# SSRMP Python Introduction 2020-2021

Welcome all! This is the Python Introduction for the **Social Sciences Research Methods Programme** (SSRMP) at the University of Cambridge.

#### Can I use this if I'm not part of the PyBrain workshop?

Sure, go for it! The worksheets should be pretty self-explanatory, so you're very welcome to go through them independently.

## Schedule

## Interactive worksheets

The worksheets for this workshop are *Jupyter Notebooks*. They can be rendered right here, on GitHub, but they won't be interactive in that way. However, you can also open them in *MyBinder* or *Google Colab*. These services will render notebooks from GitHub in an interactive environment, allowing you to run Python right in your browser!

#### MyBinder

Binder is a great open-source website created by some amazing science folks. It's important to realise that `mybinder.org` is supported by grants and donations. For that reason, it's good practice to not overload them.

- [Launch this repository on MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/esdalmaijer/Cambridge_SSRMP_Python_2020-2021/main)

As an aside, please avoid using Binder for any for-profit purposes. Financially benefiting from other people's unpaid labour is not cool. What are you, Elsevier?

#### Google Colaboratory

Google is getting in on the "running Python online" action, and has put their servers at the public's disposal (with some caveats to prevent naughty usage and/or excess traffic).

- [Writing functions and classes](https://colab.research.google.com/github/esdalmaijer/Cambridge_SSRMP_Python_2020-2021/blob/main/02_functions_classes/02_functions_classes.ipynb)
- [NumPy and reading data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/esdalmaijer/Cambridge_SSRMP_Python_2020-2021/blob/main/03_numpy_reading_data/03_numpy_reading_data.ipynb)
- [Data handling and visualisation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/esdalmaijer/Cambridge_SSRMP_Python_2020-2021/blob/main/04_data_visualisation/04_data_visualisation.ipynb)
- [Implementing statistical tests](https://colab.research.google.com/github/esdalmaijer/Cambridge_SSRMP_Python_2020-2021/blob/main/05_statistical_tests/05_statistical_tests.ipynb)
- [Model fitting through minimisation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/esdalmaijer/Cambridge_SSRMP_Python_2020-2021/blob/main/06_model_fitting/06_model_fitting.ipynb)

Follow these steps to use the Jupyter Notebooks:

1. Log into your Google account.
2. Open a notebook.
3. There will come a time during which you will need to read files. Google Colab is a bit weird about that. The Notebooks will tell you how to deal with it, and you can pro-actively follow the rest of these steps.
4. Open Google Drive.
5. Create a folder `PyBrain` on your `My Drive` space.
6. Download a handy [zipped archive](./files_for_google_colab/files_for_google_colab.zip) with all files required for the notebooks.
7. Unzip the files to your local computer.
8. Upload these files to the `PyBrain` folder on Google Drive.
9. Done! You'll be informed about how to use these files in the relevant Notebooks.
