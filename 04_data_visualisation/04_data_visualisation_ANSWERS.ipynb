    "## Choosing a visualisation type\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, different types of data visualisations exist, and each come with their own benefits and downsides. Bar plots can be easily understood, but also give you very little information about what the data underlying an average looks like. In addition, whether or not it makes sense to draw a bar highly depends on what kind of data you're visualising. Adding error bars to bar plots to indicate the standard error of the mean tells you something about the sampling process, whereas adding error bars to indicate the standard deviation tells you something about the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested in visualising distributions in a more detailed way, you could turn to box or violin plots. These provide a clearer picture of what your data look like, and are still quite easy to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the best type of plot is depends on the data, and on what message you would like your graph to illustrate. If you're simply saying \"these groups have different means\", a bar plot with error bars that indicate the standard error of the mean could work very well. However, if you're trying to illustrate that two groups are from distributions with different properties, you might need to turn to box or violin plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you are free to combine plots and types of visualisations. For example, you could simply throw everything into one combined plot:"
